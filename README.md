# Fermat Tokens



<br>
## Introduction

Fermat Tokens are the native application tokens of the Fermat system. End users need these tokens to pay for micro-use-licenses of the components they use while using Fermat apps and to pay for bandwidh to the Fermat Network's miners.

The Fermat Protocol issues Fermat tokens for the Foundation and to Miners according to a schedulle described at the Fermat white paper.

Currently there is no automated system to record the issuing of Fermat Tokens as the Fermat Blockchain has not been released, the recording is done manually and here we keep track of them.

## Start of Protocol Issuing

Since April 2014 the protocol started issuing tokens to the Fermat Foundation, a theorical entity by then. 

### Founders Tokens

By Februery 2015 after accumulating 2.4 million tokens the Fermat Foundation pays 2.1 million (10% of the total projected supply) to the founders of the project in a transaction we call the founders' bounty, in exchange for the design of the system and a primitive implementation of its architecture. This is a simbolic transaction since by that time each token value was $0.

### First Tokens Sale

By March 2015 a first token sale was closed: <br>
700,000 Fermat tokens where sold for 200K USD to a visionary angel investor setting the price at 1 Fermat = 0.29 USD.

## Monthy Bounties

There are three development programs running that contribute on a monthly basis to the project and Fermat tokens are used to compensate these contributions.

### Contribution Program Tokens

Every month new tokens are spent according to the [CONTRIBUTION PROGRAM](https://github.com/bitDubai/contribution-program) to pay for contributions done to the project. Below you can see the details of tokens spent related to this program.

| Year | Month | Tokens Issued | Dollar Value | USD / Fermat Rate | # Contributors |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|2015|May|25,200|7,200|0.29|5|
|2015|Jun|30,653|10,850|0.35|7|
|2015|Jul|19,348|13,550|0.70|8|
|2015|Aug|17,251|18,000|1.04|13|
|2015|Sep|18,946|26,200|1.38|20|
|2015|Oct|21,090|36,220|1.72|28|
|2015|Nov|18,141|37,917|2.05|30|
|2015|Dec|17,999|44,900|2.37|34|
|2016|Jan|17,372|52,662.50|3.03|38|

Note: Fermat Tokens prices are arbitrary set by the Fermat Foundation according to the perceived progress of the project. This technique will be discontinued once we set up open market mechanisms within Fermat to buy & sell fermats for bitcoins.


### Bounty Program Tokens

Every month new tokens are spent according to the [BOUNTY PROGRAM](https://github.com/bitDubai/bounty-program) to pay for contributions done to the project.


Several bounties have been awarded.


### Competition Program Tokens

Every month new tokens are spent according to the [DUBAI COMPETITION PROGRAM](https://github.com/bitDubai/competition/tree/master/2016AUC) to pay for contributions done maintaining components.


The first payments are schedulled for April 2016.

### Fermat Foundation Token Auctions

Starting May 2016 the Foundation will be auctioning Fermat Tokens for bitcoin in order to cover expenses. Here we keep track of the tokens auctioned by this Program.

| Year | Month | Tokens Issued | Dollar Value | USD / Fermat Rate |
